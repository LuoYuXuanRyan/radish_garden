我是Ryan，并且这里是Ryan的博客。

最终，这个博客还是写完基本功能并且上线了。这是我自己写的第一个博客，使用的是Astro这个前端框架。之所以采取这个前端框架，是考虑到Astro作为一个新兴的前端框架，在构建静态网站的时候具有良好的性能。不过，虽然Astro本身支持React，但是我并没有使用熟悉的UI库，如Semi-design。在这个项目中，我使用了推荐的TailwindCSS，虽然这是我第一次使用它，但我切身感受到了其对我的项目开发带来的便利。TailwindCSS能帮助我快速地在不离开HTML代码的情况下写样式，我不再需要绞尽脑汁给某个标签想类名（这确实拯救了我这个选择困难症患者😜），也不再需要在HTML代码和CSS代码中切来切去，这确实很省时间。当然，学习一项新的技术始终不是一件坏事，毕竟技多不压身嘛！

我第一次接触编程是在初中的计算机课上，在那时我是学习的C++语言和一些简单算法。自那时开始我就对编程产生了浓厚的兴趣。我尝试着自己编写一些小游戏，包括五子棋等，但是，在终端这样的黑框框中运行我的代码总让我觉得有些不够，我希望能编写出漂亮的程序！我第一次接触网页编程是在大学一年级，当时舍友聊天，大家都对校科协这个组织比较感兴趣，认为能从里面学到不少东西，但是最后只有三个人进入了校科协。我第一次听课就是前端组的授课，那时我本来不记得上课，还是偶然间看到宿舍的CS大佬正在看他们组的网络授课。我一想，网页不就是一种漂亮的程序吗，于是便开始学习。当时，我本觉得授课速度太快，跟不上节奏，于是没有继续听课，但却因为在寒假时完成了“Winter of Code”项目误打误撞留任了前端组并成为了一名讲师。这可能就是我跟网页开发的缘分吧！

我其实之前页写过一个博客，是基于Hexo的，如果不出意外点击链接还可以进入查看。但是，别人写的博客主题始终满足不了我的审美，而在别人的项目上作修改又过于困难。随着我网页开发技术学习的深入，我终于开始了这个项目——写一个我自己的博客——并且已经成功一半了！

目前，我的这个博客是托管在CloudFlare上的，我发现CloudFlare非常的好用，里面有很多功能，并且都有免费的额度。接下来，我将继续开发这个博客网站，并且在里面记录我学习CS的一些笔记和心得！如果你喜欢我的这个博客，请在我的GitHub项目上，给我点一个Star吧！

我是Ryan，祝你好运！

I'm Ryan, and this is Ryan's blog.

Finally, this blog is written and live with basic functionality. This is the first blog I've written on my own, using Astro as the front-end framework. The reason why I took this front-end framework is that Astro, as an emerging front-end framework, has good performance in building static websites. However, although Astro itself supports React, I didn't use familiar UI libraries such as Semi-design. in this project, I used the recommended TailwindCSS, and although this is the first time I've used it, I felt first-hand how convenient it was for my project development. tailwindCSS helps me to quickly write websites without leaving the TailwindCSS helps me to quickly write styles without leaving the HTML code, I no longer need to rack my brain to think of a class name for a tag (which saves me from being a dyslexic person 😜), and I no longer need to slice and dice between HTML and CSS code, which is a real time saver. Of course, it's never a bad thing to learn a new skill, after all, it's not a bad thing to have a lot of skills!

My first encounter with programming was in junior high school computer class, where I learnt the C++ language and some simple algorithms. At that time I learnt the C++ language and some simple algorithms. Since then I have been interested in programming. I tried to write some small games by myself, including backgammon, etc. However, running my code in a black box like a terminal always made me feel that it was not enough, and I wished to write beautiful programmes! I first came into contact with web programming in my first year of university, when my housemates were chatting and everyone was more interested in the Varsity Science Association as an organisation that they thought they could learn quite a lot from, but in the end, only three of us got into the Varsity Science Association. The first time I attended a class was the front-end group's lecture. I didn't remember attending the class at that time, but I stumbled upon the dormitory's CS bigwigs watching their group's web lectures. I thought, ‘Isn't a web page a beautiful programme?’ and started to learn it. At that time, I thought the speed of the lectures was too fast to keep up with the pace, so I didn't continue to listen to the lectures, but because I completed the ‘Winter of Code’ project during the winter holidays, I mistakenly stayed in the front-end group and became an instructor. That's probably my connection to web development!

I actually wrote a blog on a previous page, which is based on Hexo, so if you click on the link, you can still access it. However, the theme of other people's blogs never satisfied my aesthetics, and it was too difficult to make changes on other people's projects. As I learnt more about web development techniques, I finally embarked on this project - writing a blog of my own - and am halfway there!

Currently, I'm hosting this blog on CloudFlare, which I've found to be very usable, with lots of features in it and all with free credits. Next, I will continue to develop this blog site and record some of my notes and insights from learning CS in it! If you like this blog of mine, please give me a Star on my GitHub project!

I'm Ryan, and good luck to you!
